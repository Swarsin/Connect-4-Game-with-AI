# Connect-4-Game-with-AI
(My ongoing project)


Through Harvard CS50's Artificial Intelligence with Python course and further research into AlphaGo, I learned about adversarial search, Monte Carlo Tree Search and Minimax algorithm and their applications in board games. 
Intrigued, I set out to make an AI player for Connect 4, using a minimax algorithm.


I soon aim to incorporate alpha-beta pruning with minimax in order to reduce the processing time of the program greatly, and increase responsiveness, especially in lower end computers.
